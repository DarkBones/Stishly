[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/620167b91540484f90a72049fd7cabfd)](https://app.codacy.com/app/donkerbc/Stishly?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=DarkBones/Stishly&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

Stishly is an app that lets you easily manage your personal finances. Users can set up their bank and cash accounts and record their transactions on them. They can set up schedules for their fixed expenses and for their income so they always know exactly how much they can spend on a given day.

All information users put into the application is secure. For instance, any personally identifiable information such as their name and email address are encrypted using Amazon KMS, so even the developer of this app can't see who is using the app.

The development of this app is still in progress, but a test build is currently available at https://stishly.com.
