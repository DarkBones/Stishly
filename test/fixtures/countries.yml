# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

ie: {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Ireland',
  date_format: 'dd/mm/yyyy',
  week_start: 1,
  country_code: 'IE',
}
